# rust-datastructures-algorithms

The purpose of this Rust crate is a library of data structures and sorting and search algorithms that use said data structures.

In March 2025, I completed a grad-level course on data structures and algorithms at Drexel. In this class, we implemented many classic versions of these in C. I am interested in trying to reproduce this work in Rust, as it is the programming language I am primarily interested in developing my skill and familiarity in. In doing this, I aim to more thoroughly understand not only the data structures and algorithms I will implement, but also more extensively understand Rust and its particular features in a working context. I also want to benchmark the results in computer clock cycles of my implementations in Rust to compare against the performance of my implementations in C.
